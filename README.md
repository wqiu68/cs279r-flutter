One of Flutter's biggest advantage is being able to create separate pages for mobile and desktop, regardless of the browser. Previously, javascript (JS) could not complete this thought JS can handle a large number of simple requests. Flutter uses Dart instead of Node.js. Dart uses libraries, a virtual machine and toold. It is useful becaue it creates a scalable platform that can run on the web. Node.js is incorporated with JS and it also creates scalable network applications. Noted online, it states "Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices."

I do think the learning curve of Flutter is a bit higher than Node.js and JS but I do think when it comes to creating applications, Flutter is a bit easier.
